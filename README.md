# ActorsGallery
A simple REST API that enables users to fetch information about motion picture episodes and characters, and post comments.


## Overview
This is a back-end service which can be consumed by any web client that supports sending and receiving data in JSON format. 
This application is a work in progress. Consequently, certain features, particularly 'authentication', 'update' and 'delete' operations, will be available in the next version.
